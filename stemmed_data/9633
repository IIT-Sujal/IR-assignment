function overload sort thing time 
bc++ without hitch big problem encount 
port mfc bc++ fact mfc depend coupl 
invalid c++ assumpt 

never gotten entir ctrltest app run bc++ 
reason ms make bad assumpt order 
staticglob object initializ ie object 
gett access initializ problem 
ownerdraw menu code somewher comment section 
piec ctrltest work fine 

two major gotcha found us mfc bc++ 

cfileopenflag enum us hardcod number open mode 
rather manifest constant defin fcntrlh differ 
msc bc 

mfc collect class depend anoth bad c++ 
assumpt refer base object can us place 
refer deriv object true pointer
