understand eisa video card group 
level perform local bu card given eisa video 
card 32 bit bu move data around instead isa' 8 bit 

good question 
answer eisa bu move 32 bit rather isa' 816 
still move speed isa bu 
think either 8 10 mhz 
local bu design also move 32 bit like eisa 
move data cpu speed 40 mhz 
33mhz cpu local bu move 32bit data 
33 mhz eisa move 32bit data 8 10 mhz 
local bu 3 4 time faster eisa 
33 mhz cpu eisa two maybe 3 time 
fast isa
