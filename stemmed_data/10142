eisa machin just understand 
eisa video card match perform isa 
counterpart instanc eisa orchid pro design iis 
"fast" isa diamond speedstar plu 
call "fast" 

understand eisa video card group 
level perform local bu card given eisa video 
card 32 bit bu move data around instead isa' 8 bit 

good question 
answer eisa bu move 32 bit rather isa' 816 
still move speed isa bu 
think either 8 10 mhz 
local bu design also move 32 bit like eisa 
move data cpu speed 40 mhz 
33mhz cpu local bu move 32bit data 
33 mhz eisa move 32bit data 8 10 mhz 
local bu 3 4 time faster eisa 
33 mhz cpu eisa two maybe 3 time 
fast isa 

expect eisa board twice fast isa 
board move data path twice wide 
least differ number clock requir 
bu transact two buss isa board requir 
multipl clock per bu transact typicalli around 34 
eisa board suppos abl 'burst' 11 rate 
expect perform 6x8x isa card 

guess question unansw still expect 
abl see 6x speed differ appar
